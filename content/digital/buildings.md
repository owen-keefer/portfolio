Invisible Buildings

Procedural Generation

An exploration of generative design using geometry nodes and python scripting to create a system for randomly generating buildings.  Process-based approach allows for rapid iteration with scale, proportion, and texture.  Inspired by Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities.
